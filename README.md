## Overview

This is a repo for building and deploying a static site, generated with Hugo.

It is available at jakedanielturner.co.uk

The website's existence is two-fold: one, to fulfil a graduate scheme assigned project to create a 'Little Digital Notebook of Knowledge', which could serve as a space to 
document my experiences on my graduate scheme. During its development, I also realised there is a whole host of *other* material I could publish, too, such as my other
experiences in life.
