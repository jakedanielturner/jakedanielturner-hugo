Hello! My name is Jake (he/him/his). I'm a graduate software engineer at the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA, for short), based between Nottingham and Swansea.

I'm currently living in Cardiff, with my girlfriend Becca. I'm originally from Kidderminster, and spent three years at Sheffield Hallam University, where I studied for a
BSc in Airline and Airport Management.

Outside of work, I'm an avid football fan, following Kidderminster Harriers and Sheffield United. I play dodgeball as often as life allows, now playing for Rhondda Dragons.
I also enjoy playing Rocket League, and wasting endless amounts of time on Reddit.
