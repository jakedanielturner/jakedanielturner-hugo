👋 **Hello!** My name is Jake (he/him/his). I'm a graduate software engineer at the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA, for short), based between Nottingham and Swansea.

🏠 I'm currently living in Cardiff, with my girlfriend Becca. I'm originally from Kidderminster, and spent three years at Sheffield Hallam University, where I studied for a
BSc in Airline and Airport Management.

🤾‍♂️ Outside of work, I'm an avid football fan, following Kidderminster Harriers and Sheffield United. I play dodgeball as often as life allows, now playing for Rhondda Dragons.
I also enjoy playing Rocket League, and wasting endless amounts of time on Reddit.

🖼️ Below is a photo of me. You may see it around the web multiple times - it's because I don't have many good photos, or at least good photos I'm willing to share widely on the internet. Until such a time comes where I do, you'll have to get used to it unfortunately!
