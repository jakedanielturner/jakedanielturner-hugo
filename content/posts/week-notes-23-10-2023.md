I've wanted to do these for a while, and keep forgetting, but let's try üòÖ

Work:

    - Had a great couple days in Bristol with the entire team - sad realising that is likely the last time I go to Bristol for a while

    - Started prepping like mad for my upcoming AWS Certification exam, before realising I needed more time and rescheduling it for two weeks time. Unfortunately means I'll miss out on the Cloud Certification October thingy, but better to give myself the best possible shot at it.

    - Awaiting the day I can ask Alexa to create my CloudWatch dashboard, and she does it all for me.
    
        - On a serious note, exploring the possibility of posting metrics directly to CloudWatch from Lambda, without having to scan logs for them. It'll make things a bit easier to control I think, and allows for more flexibility, as well as being just generally cooler.

Life:
    - Lots of death around recently ‚òπÔ∏è a friends sister who unfortunately decided her time had come, the awful news about Adam Johnson in Sheffield, and Matthew Perry, too.
    - Started reading again, after taking a long, albeit unenforced, break - the new Hunger Games film is out soon and I want to read it before I see it.
    - Kidderminster lost ‚òπÔ∏è unfortunately becoming a common theme, but we're heading for a decent run of games soon where we should/need to pick up points.
    - Maybe heading to Sheffield next weekend? Be good to see some mates and play some dodgeball for a good cause.
    - Got in a 10k run - something else I have taken an unenforced break from. The weather turned and now the clocks have gone back it means running in the dark, which isn't super fun.
    - Currently on a lasagna binge - must've made about three in the last two weeks.
    - Having no end of trouble with the bins outside our place - people down the road don't do theirs properly, and then someone has the nerve to put their wrong bins outside of ours. I'm torn between "who cares" and "major fuming".
    - Just realised Hugo format these like I'd hoped - investigation required üò¨
        - I also need to fix the GitHub link on the bottom, which just points to this site ü´†
Watching:
    - Modern Family
    - Big Brother

Reading:
    - The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes - Suzanne Collins
