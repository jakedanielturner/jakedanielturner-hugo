I sort of forgot about this.

I didn't, actually. It's just never really served a purpose. The 'project' for which this was developed is effectively dead, with more emphasis being placed on actually using *something* which works, which is probably what it should've been from the beginning. I have, admittedly, missed out on a whole lot of documentation which may have been somewhat useful from my first year. It's crazy to think it's actually been a year (two weeks today!) since I started, and the journey I have been on since then. The imposter syndrome feeling still hasn't really died down, and I'm not sure it ever will, but I find it has become a bit more manageable and I do actually feel a sense of belonging on my team - which is crazy further.

Nonetheless, I am left with this website which carries my name and it would be *nice* to do something with it. I like the idea of doing weeknotes, so maybe I'll start that. It's also a good place to document some learning, as I originally intended, and that could tie in nicely with the second year of my scheme - somewhere to link further ramblings about such and such a project.

Hopefully this is not just further shouting into the abyss, dreaming up grand plans only for them to fall on the rocks. It would genuinely be nice to have a detailed collection of notes on topics such as AWS (other cloud providers are available), or Docker, and so on. We've been given a new 'Learning and Personal Development Tracker' which I would like to be able to attach such notes to, and provide me with more space for writing.

So let's try it, shall we?
